## Credits

I received assistance from tutor Corey Yates.

The original code was created by Xandromus Rapstine and can be found in this link [https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram].

I watched this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fu6IdhpuLkk&t=68s] to create a theme and be able to deploy the webpage.
